        I got my first taste of programming through HTML and CSS back in 2018, and I have been improving my skills ever since! Shortly after starting with programming, I landed a development internship at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints working on a SAAS. Immediately after the internship ended I took the skills I learned and got a full-time job as a Software Engineer at Henry Schein One working on Dentrix Ascend, a cloud-based dental practice software. I am currently doing everything I can to improve my skills as a programmer and further my career as a Software Engineer. Some of my other hobbies include songwriting and music production, spending time with my family, and learning about new and unfamiliar things. If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:a.abbott2596@gmail.com">a.abbott2596@gmail.com</a>.
